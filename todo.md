## Project Assets Inventory
- **Documents**: 29 files (Doc 0-5, Supplements 1-4, References)
- **Images**: 120+ high-resolution screenshots and visualizations

## Key Workflow Rules (from Process Analysis)
1. Build on Manus first (not GitHub)
2. Review with user before deployment
3. Follow documented plans BEFORE starting work
4. Pause at critical decision points
5. Deployment is final step, not the goal
